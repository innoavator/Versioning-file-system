<p><code>SVG</code> (Scalable Vector Graphics)<br>
An XML specification and file format for expressing 2D vector graphics.
Many web browsers can display SVG; for image processing you can use the <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> software. SVG files are always
converted to PNG by the job management system in normal conditions.
</p><p><code>TXT</code> (Tabulator delimited text with column headings)<br>
Primary format for storing numeric results. Compatible with MS Excel. If
you are using an older version of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>, convert filename extension
to '.csv' before opening.

</p><h3 id="start">Getting started</h3>
Himmeli requires two input files to work. The first, referred to as the
<i>configuration file</i>, contains the instructions that specify
where to look for the graph data and how to visualize it. Furthermore, the
name of the configuration file is the only command line argument that Himmeli
accepts, everything else is defined by the instructions. If you call
Himmeli without any command line arguments, a concise listing of all features
is printed on the screen.

<p>
The second file, referred to as the <i>edge file</i>, contains the edges of
the graph in tabulated plain text format. The first non-empty line of the file
must contain the headings of the variable columns and the subsequent lines
specify the graph topology. For each edge, you have to list at least the
names of the end points on a single line of text in order for the edge to be
registered by Himmeli.

</p><p>
Brief instructions on how to install the program on various platforms and
operating systems can be found within the installation package.

</p><h3 id="basic">Basic graph</h3>
A graph is essentialy a set of relationships (edges or links or arcs,
depending on context) between distinguishable entities (vertices or nodes).
Consequently, the minimum dataset that can be visualized by Himmeli consists
of pairs of vertices, denoted by the <i>tail vertex</i> (starting point) and
the <i>head vertex</i> (end point). For now, it is assumed that the graph is
undirected and no attention is paid to the order of vertices within a pair.

<p>
For practical reasons, Himmeli needs to know also the file that contains the
graph data as a tabulator delimited plain text table (edge file) and the name
of the graph for creating the result files later. Below is a transcript of a
basic setup for a small graph (on a UNIX system):

</p><pre>[vpm himmelidemo]$ cat config.txt 
GraphName       demoGraph
EdgeFile        edges.txt
EdgeHeadVariable        HEAD
EdgeTailVariable        TAIL

[vpm himmelidemo]$ head -n 10 edges.txt 
HEAD    TAIL
r0      r1
r1      r2
r2      r3
r3      r4
r4      r5
r5      r6
r6      r7
r7      r8
r8      s0
</pre>

You can also use full paths for <code>GraphName</code> and
<code>EdgeFile</code> (e.g. '/home/johndoe/results/demoGraph' and
'/home/johndoe/himmelidemo/edges.txt'), which is useful if you want to store
the results in another directory. Note, however, that Himmeli does not create
new directories, so only existing paths can be used.

<p>
The connection between the configuration and edge files is made through the
column headings: here the column <code>HEAD</code> contains the head vertex
names for each of the pairs that form the graph. Notice how the same heading
is listed as <code>EdgeHeadVariable</code> in the configuration file. The
column headings can be anything (as long as they do not contain white space);
the only requirement is that there is an unambiguous match between the
configuration and edge files. Himmeli can now be started:

The screen output begins with version information and copyright statement for
the various software modules within Himmeli. Next, a listing of the basic
parameters is shown (there are also others, see the
<a href="#index">index</a>). So far none of them is configured manually, so
the default values are listed, but they will be modified in later
sections of this document.

<p>
After data imports, the detected variables are listed on the screen. There
were only two data columns, hence only two are detected. The last entry in
the listing indicates the number of the column: the head vertex data were
correctly detected in the first column.

<table style="font-size: 16px;" align="right">
<tbody><tr><td><a class="img" href="files/figure1.png">

</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
Himmeli makes no assumptions about the topology of the graph. Before
visualization, though, the graph must be broken into connected components
for technical reasons. Here we have three components and the largest comprise
19 vertices and 22 edges. Next the vertex layout is calculated
for each component separately. This is the computationally most demanding
phase and can take a long time for large graphs.

</p><p>
Finally, the drawings are saved in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format,
and the layouts are stored in plain text tables. The text files will be
covered later in the section on <a href="#repeat">repeatable layouts</a>. The
drawing for the largest component is shown in Figure 1.

</p><h3 id="weight">Weighted edges</h3>
Drawing the binary links between vertices is the first step. In more realistic
situations, it is often possible to quantify the strength or importance of an
edge, with respect to the other edges. Previously, the <i>weight</i> of an
edge was automatically set to a constant value due to the technical fact that
Himmeli was primarily designed for weighted edge sets.

<p>
To import quantitative weight data into Himmeli, add an
<code>EdgeWeightVariable</code> instruction in the configuration file:

</p><pre>[vpm himmelidemo]$ cat config.txt 
GraphName	demoGraph
EdgeFile	edges.txt	
EdgeHeadVariable	HEAD	
EdgeTailVariable	TAIL	
EdgeWeightVariable	WEIGHT  # New!
DecorationMode		on      # New!

[vpm himmelidemo]$ head -n 10 edges.txt 
HEAD	TAIL	WEIGHT
r0	r1	1.1
r1	r2	0.6
r2	r3	1.0
r3	r4	1.4
r4	r5	1.3
r5	r6	2.7
r6	r7	1.5
r7	r8	1.3
r8	s0	1.7
</pre>

The weights can be any positive real numbers. Note that values close to or
less than zeros will cause a rejection of the edge in question, and missing
values or non-numerical entries are interpreted as zeros. The weight value
range can be anything; Himmeli will normalize the weights automatically.
If necessary, the normalization feature can be controlled manually, see
the section on <a href="#repeat">pruning and hiding edges</a> for details.

<table style="font-size: 16px;" align="right">
<tbody><tr><td><a class="img" href="files/figure2.png">
  <img class="link" src="files/figure2_tn.png" alt="Figure 2" align="right"></a>
</td></tr><tr><td><center><b>Figure 2</b></center>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>
The edge weights affect the layout by pulling those vertices closer that have
a strong link between them. To make the weights more apparent, the color and
width of each line can be set to reflect the edge strength. By setting
<code>DecorationMode</code> 'on', Himmeli will determine the graphical
features automatically. If manual control is preferred, see the section on
<a href="#manual">manual colors</a> for further details.

</p><p>
The automatic decorations also extend to the vertices: those vertices that
have many adjacent edges (high degree) are drawn with bigger symbols, and
the color is determined by the sum of the weights of the adjacent edges. The
results are depicted in Figure 2.

</p><h3 id="direct">Directed and labeled edges</h3>
So far the direction of an edge had no significance on the way it was
depicted. However, many real world networks contain information on directed
associations. A gene transcription and expression network is one example:
a transcription factor triggers gene expression, which in turn triggers new
genes and so on. As mentioned earlier, the directionality is encoded in the
head and tail vertex lists. A transcription factor for a gene would thus be
encoded as the tail, and the target gene as the head, within a vertex pair.

<p>
The direction does not affect the vertex layout (except the distance unit)
but it changes the way edges are drawn. To show arrows instead of lines,
<code>ArrowMode</code> should be activated.

</p><p>
Color and width are effective means to convey the edge weight information,
but sometimes it is useful to have labels on the edges for extra guidance.
Labeling in Himmeli is controlled via <code>LabelMode</code>: by default it
is set to 'vertex', which makes Himmeli to print the names of vertices. To
show also edge weights, it can be fully activated (set it to 'on'). The
automatic labels can be replaced by user-defined text if necessary
(<code>EdgeLabelVariable</code> and <code>VertexLabelVariable</code>).

<table style="font-size: 16px;" align="right">
<tbody><tr><td><a class="img" href="files/figure3.png">
  <img class="link" src="files/figure3_tn.png" alt="Figure 3" align="right"></a>
</td></tr><tr><td><center><b>Figure 3</b></center>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
Suppose the graph was a results of several different methodologies. It is
then useful to denote which method was used to uncover a particular connection
between the vertices. Also, you can add other extra information that might
be relevant when intepreting the figure. To add user-defined labels for edges,
a new column must be added to the edge file:

</p><pre>[vpm himmelidemo]$ cat config.txt 
GraphName	demoGraph
EdgeFile	edges.txt	
EdgeHeadVariable	HEAD	
EdgeTailVariable	TAIL	
EdgeWeightVariable	WEIGHT
EdgeLabelVariable	LABEL   # New!
ArrowMode	on              # New!
LabelMode	on              # New!
DecorationMode		on

[vpm himmelidemo]$ head -n 10 edges.txt 
HEAD	TAIL	WEIGHT	LABEL
r0	r1	1.1	methodA
r1	r2	0.6	methodB
r2	r3	1.0	
r3	r4	1.4	methodC
r4	r5	1.3	methodA
r5	r6	2.7
r6	r7	1.5	methodA
r7	r8	1.3	error?
r8	s0	1.7	methodB
</pre>

Adding arrowheads and labels to the graph requires more space to prevent
undesired overlap of element. Therefore Himmeli adjusts
<code>DistanceUnit</code> automatically to meet the needs. Of course, you can
override this in the configuration file, if necessary. The directed drawing
is shown in Figure 3.

<h3 id="manual">Manual colors</h3>
While it is convenient to have all the colors and other visual attributes
automatically selected, in some cases you may need to set the colors based on
other criteria than just edge weights. Himmeli makes this possible via two
dedicated instructions <code>EdgeColorVariable</code> and
<code>EdgeWidthVariable</code>.

<table style="font-size: 16px;" align="right">
<tbody><tr><td><a class="img" href="files/figure4.png">
  <img class="link" src="files/figure4_tn.png" alt="Figure 4" align="right"></a>
</td></tr><tr><td><center><b>Figure 4</b></center>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>
The human eye has three types of color-sensitive receptors, for red, green
and blue. Consequently, colors are usually represented as a combination of
the three main components according to the suitably named RGB scheme. In
most web pages the color codes are hexadecimal numbers (such as A0F542) that
indicate the red intensity in the first two digits, green in the next two and
blue in the last two digits. Himmeli follows the same convention, except that
the numbers are decimal to make the codes easier to use. Some examples are
illustrated in Figure 4.

<table style="font-size: 16px;" align="right">
<tbody><tr><td><a class="img" href="files/figure5.png">
  <img class="link" src="files/figure5_tn.png" alt="Figure 5" align="right"></a>
</td></tr><tr><td><center><b>Figure 5</b></center>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
Suppose the sample graph represents a metabolite network, where the vertices
are metabolites and the edges describe their effects on the concentrations
during a continuous process. To get the most out of the visualizations, the
type of effect can be coded into the line colors so that a simultaneous
increase of two metabolites is painted red, whereas a negatively correlated
pair is painted blue. Some changes are needed in the configuration and edge
files:

</p><pre>[vpm himmelidemo]$ cat config.txt 
GraphName	demoGraph
EdgeFile	edges.txt	
EdgeHeadVariable	HEAD	
EdgeTailVariable	TAIL	
EdgeWeightVariable	WEIGHT
EdgeLabelVariable	LABEL
EdgeColorVariable	COLOR   # New!
ArrowMode	on
LabelMode	on
DecorationMode		on

[vpm himmelidemo]$ head -n 10 edges.txt 
HEAD	TAIL	WEIGHT	LABEL	COLOR
r0	r1	1.1	methodA	991000
r1	r2	0.6	methodB	002099
r2	r3	1.0		991000
r3	r4	1.4	methodC	991000
r4	r5	1.3	methodA	002099
r5	r6	2.7		991000
r6	r7	1.5	methodA	002099
r7	r8	1.3	error?	991000
r8	s0	1.7	methodB	991000
</pre>

If some of the color data is missing or invalid, the corresponding edges will
be painted with a default color. If you wish to hide a specific edge, set the
width to non-positive via <code>EdgeWidthVariable</code> (see also the section
on <a href="#prune">pruning and hiding</a>). The results for the manually
colored graph are shown in Figure 5.

<h3 id="vertex">Vertex shapes and fill patterns</h3>
In the previous section the edges were colored according to their function
in a hypothetical metabolite network. The same customization is also possible
for the vertices, although a new <i>vertex file</i> must be created to pass
the extra information to Himmeli:

<pre>[vpm himmelidemo]$ cat config.txt 
GraphName	demoGraph
EdgeFile	edges.txt
VertexFile	vertices.txt    # New!
EdgeHeadVariable	HEAD	
EdgeTailVariable	TAIL	
EdgeWeightVariable	WEIGHT
EdgeLabelVariable	LABEL
EdgeColorVariable	COLOR
VertexNameVariable	NAME    # New!
VertexColorVariable	COLOR   # New!
VertexShapeVariable	SHAPE   # New!
VertexPatternVariable	PATTERN # New!
ArrowMode	on
LabelMode	on
DecorationMode		on

[vpm himmelidemo]$ head -n 10 vertices.txt 
NAME	COLOR	SHAPE	PATTERN
r0	909090	circle
r1	994030	triangle
r2	307099	triangle	stripe
r3	994030	triangle
r4	994030	triangle	stripe/45
r5	307099	triangle
r6	994030	triangle	spot
r7	307099	triangle
r8	994030	triangle
</pre>

Those vertices that have only positive (red) arrows to other vertices are
colored red (R=99, G=40, B=30), those with only negative arrows pointing
to other vertices are colored blue (R=30, G=70, B=99), those with both
are painted magenta (R=90, G=10, B=90), and finally the one vertex with no
outward connections is painted light-grey.

<p>
Note the new instructions in the configuration file: <code>VertexFile</code>
tells where to look for vertex data, <code>VertexNameVariable</code> is needed
to find the data records of individual vertices, and the
<code>VertexColorVariable</code> denotes the column with color data. Although
both the edge and vertex files have a column named 'COLOR', there is no
ambiguity since the columns are located in different files. Of course they do
not have to be the same in general, as long as the configuration file and data
files are consistent.

<table style="font-size: 16px;" align="right">
<tbody><tr><td><a class="img" href="files/figure6.png">
  <img class="link" src="files/figure6_tn.png" alt="Figure 6" align="right"></a>
</td></tr><tr><td><center><b>Figure 6</b></center>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
In addition to color, the configuration file contains instructions that
control vertex shapes (<code>VertexShapeVariable</code>) and filling
patterns within the symbols (<code>VertexPatternVariable</code>). The shapes
and patterns are denoted by text keys and an optional rotation angle
in degrees. For instance, to draw a diamond shape you start with a square
and then rotate it 45 degrees to produce the final code string 'square/45'.

</p><p>
The fill patterns behave the same way as the shapes. For example, to create
diagonal stripes, you start with the default horizontal stripes and then
rotate by 45 degrees to produce the code string 'stripe/45'. Additional
examples of vertex colors, shapes and patterns are shown in Figures 4 and 6.

</p><h3 id="prune">Pruning and hiding edges</h3>
For complex networks (in the topology sense) two-dimensional layout is always
non-optimal and often somewhat difficult to grasp. One way to make the
visualization clearer is to reduce the number of elements depicted in the
figure according to pre-defined criteria. As a first step, a maximum spanning
tree can provide insight into the topology, even if it discards most of the
edges. Himmeli does the tree layout automatically if <code>ChassisMode</code>
is activated.

<table style="font-size: 16px;" align="right">
<tbody><tr><td><a class="img" href="files/figure7.png">
  <img class="link" src="files/figure7_tn.png" alt="Figure 7" align="right"></a>
</td></tr><tr><td><center><b>Figure 7</b></center>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>
Another way to reduce the number of edges is to remove those with small
(or large) weights. Himmeli has a built-in filter feature
(<code>EdgeWeightFilter</code>) which makes it possible to exclude certain
edges without manipulating the edge file. The filter has two operating
modes: if set to 'abs' all edges with a weight below the lower or above the
higher limit will be removed from the graph prior to any analyses. If set
to 'frac', the limits denote weight quantiles; to remove the smallest 10%
you can use the instruction <code>EdgeWeightFilter frac 0.1 1.0</code> in the
configuration file.

</p><p>
The results are depicted in Figure 7. The largest connected component is now
smaller (18 vertices and 19 edges) since some of the vertices became
unconnected due to the removal of the affected edges.
 
</p><p>
Often the preferred approach is to include all the edges when computing the
layout, but leave out some from the final figure. This can be accomplished
with <code>EdgeWeightMask</code> which works the same way as the edge filter
except that the unwanted edges are removed only from the figures but are
included everywhere else. In fact, the effect of the weight mask is equivalent
to setting the width of the affected edges to zero. Note also that a filter
and a mask can be applied simultaneously, if necessary.

</p><h3 id="repeat">Repeatable layouts</h3>
If you have already tried Himmeli repeatedly, you may have noticed that the
vertex layouts differ between each run of the program. This is due to the
adaptive nature of the layout algorithm: it adjusts the internal parameters
continuously according to the available calendar time (set by
<code>TimeLimit</code>) and since the operating system allocates an
unpredictable amount of processing resources for Himmeli, the resulting
layouts are, in general, indeterministic.

<p>
To overcome this unwanted "feature", Himmeli offers additional text files that
simplify the reproduction of previously calculated layouts. The three files
(new configuration, edge and vertex files) contain all the information about
the graph, so you can store them instead of the figure files as a backup
of the layout. Specifically, the layout coordinates are stored in the columns
indicated by <code>VertexXVariable</code> and <code>VertexYVariables</code>.

</p><p>
The new configuration file contains the instructions from the oiginal file,
but also additional commands that override some of the original settings.
Also, the new edge and vertex files are accessed instead of the original
data files. To reconstruct the figures, simply use the command
<code>himmeli demoGraph.config.txt</code> and the SVG files will be recreated.
Obviously the names of the text files depend on the graph name; here it
was set to 'demoGraph' in the original configuration file. The drawings
will be identical to the originals, but there may be some small differences
in the element information figure (demoGraph.info.svg) and edge and vertex
files (demograph.edges.txt and demograph.vertices.txt). In particular, the
edge weights were already normalized when stored, so the original values are
lost.

</p><h3 id="info">Information elements</h3>
If the edges and vertices are visualized according to a pre-defined scheme,
it is concenient to have the symbol information available in the figure. In
earlier versions of Himmeli the software put the user-supplied items
automatically in the figure files. After the migration to SVG, the users
themselves can do this much better with
<a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, hence the automatic
positioning is no longer supported.

<table style="font-size: 16px;" align="right">

</td></tr><tr><td><center><b>Figure 8</b></center>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>
The extra meta-data can be supplied to Himmeli via the
<i>info instructions</i> (such as <code>VertexColorInfo</code>, see the
<a href="#index">index</a> for more details) that take two parameters, the
first of which specifies a short text description and the latter indicates
the corresponding visual element (e.g. color). Below are some examples of
